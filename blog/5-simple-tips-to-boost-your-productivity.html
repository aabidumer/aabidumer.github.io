                <p>I think it’s fair to say that we all want to accomplish more in our lives, but oftentimes it’s not easy nor obvious how exactly to go about it. Too frequently we find excuses to procrastinate and not get our work done. When you find yourself trying to decide between being productive and doing what you really want to do, well — you get stuck. The good news is, I’ve come up with five easy-to-implement tips that can help improve your ability to finish important tasks!</p>

                <h1>Tip #1: Limit Distractions</h1>
                <p>For most of us, it’s easier to get distracted than it is to stay focused on our work. Whether it’s surfing the internet, checking our email, or scrolling on Twitter, there’s always something that takes our attention away from what we really need to be getting done. The best way to limit your distractions is to rid of their source: your devices. I know this sounds obvious, but simply powering off or silencing your cellphone will greatly lessen the temptation of checking for a notification that comes through. Whether you have to put it in another room or just across the desk, having only your work in front of you will make it a whole hell of a lot easier to focus.</p>

                <p>A device may not be the only thing that distracts you; it could be a loud sibling, child, roommate, etc. This is why I recommend picking up a pair of headphones (particularly noise-cancelling ones) to drown out any outside interruptions. It will vary from person-to-person, but having some kind of music/noise can help you focus. Do remember that is good for the brain to work, but not to multitask. You’ll probably have trouble focusing on more important work while you’re also trying to understand what’s being said on a podcast. Because of this, non-wordy music, lo-fi beats, and white noise are all great examples of sounds you can (and should) utilize. For me personally, while doing something that doesn’t require me to have complete attention and brainpower, (like cleaning, walking, doing the dishes, etc.) I do enjoy listening to podcasts.</p>
            <h1>Tip #2: Organize Your Tasks</h1>
            <p>Figuring out everything that you need to get done and putting it into a calendar or to-do list is a great way to become more productive. The first thing to remember when organizing your tasks is to not write a super long list. Set a reasonable goal: separate and focus on the 3 or so important tasks for the day rather than overwhelming yourself with everything you have to worry about this week. Over time, doing this makes the small list you’ve created less of a chore and more of a motivation.</p>

            <p>Try and complete the hard and less desirable tasks early on so that you have the rest of the day to focus on the smaller and easier things. I highly recommend the app <a href="notion.so" target="_blank">Notion</a> for organization. It did take quite a bit for me to tailor it to my liking, but I'm extremely happy with it. I have a “master” agenda to keep track of everything I need to get done for the week, and a list of what needs to get done today. It helps to take very large tasks and break them down into smaller pieces. If you have a blog post you want to write, instead of just putting down “write post”, say “write intro to post”. I also have separate pages to outline individual tasks, for example, jotting down the points for this article. Make sure that your tasks/goals are specific and as I mentioned earlier, realistic.</p>
            

            <h1>Tip #3: Have A Routine</h1>
            <p>Having a daily routine and schedule will help you to work more efficiently and become more productive as a whole. While it may seem obvious, getting enough sleep is extremely important. Going to bed and waking up at a similar time will help you to feel energized and ready to work. You want to make completing tasks a habit so that you don’t have to work as hard to get things done. A routine can give you a sense of accomplishment that will push you to achieve more.</p>

            <p>If you have never had much of a routine, it’s okay to start small. Even if it’s just waking up at 6 am and making breakfast, you will still benefit. Once you get used to your new routine, you can begin adding on to it. Maybe you want to head to the gym at 7 and shower at 8. After a little while, you'll form an organized schedule that you are accustomed to. This process makes completing tasks much easier than trying to without much order.</p>

            <h1>Tip #4: Start A Journal</h1>
            <p>Having a journal is an awesome way to keep track of your thoughts, as well as increase your productivity. Circling back to distractions, we often have random thoughts that pop up in our heads. Your mind fixates on things that you haven’t completed, so quickly jotting these thoughts down is a great way to remember them so you can focus on the current moment. A journal also allows you to reflect on yourself and your growth. You can look back to what you wrote to see the progress you are making, which can be a huge motivation. A journal is a great way to build self-discipline that can help you follow a routine. By forcing yourself to write a log every day, you build a habit that will overlap with other ones.</p>

            <h1>Tip #5: Take Breaks</h1>
            <p>There is an extremely toxic culture that exists in society today: workaholism. It convinces us that it’ll pay-off to sacrifice a break to instead work longer and harder. This simply isn’t true. By doing this, we get burned out and actually become less productive. Whenever you begin to feel stressed or overwhelmed, take 15 minutes to refresh your mind. Go for a walk, grab a cup of coffee, or scroll through Twitter. Think of your mind as one of your muscles. If you were to lift weights at the gym for longer than you can handle, you‘d get sore and those reps would be less efficient. Why treat your brain any different?
            </p>

            <h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
            <p>We all want to increase our productivity, but it’s easier said than done. Don’t overcomplicate it. There’s no magic pill that you can take to maximize your time. You’ll go through plenty of trial and error before you can create habits that work for, not against you.</p>
